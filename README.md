Description
Early research indicates haemoglobin concentration can be detected via the analysis of PPG signals. If research is validated, the need for invasive procedures requiring patient blood can be eliminated reducing discomfort, infection and wastage.

Human haemoglobin has maximum absorbance at two wavelengths, 810nm and 1300nm. A PPG signal consists of a primary peak and primary trough. By determining the average ratio of these peaks for both 810nm and 1300nm and subsequenting finding the ratio of ratios (810nm:1300nm), a value is obtained that can be mapped to a standard (criterion based; age and gender) thus revealing the haemoglobin of the patient.
